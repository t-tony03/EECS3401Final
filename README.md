# EECS3401Final
final project for EECS3401

final_rev2 is the notebook for our classification task
inside other tasks is an older prototype of the classification task and two other notebooks that preform a regression task on in-game gold (for fun of course)

additional notes:
- users should be aware that the randomized search is written to use ALL of the CPU, users may want to limit CPU usage by changing the "n_jobs" tag to the number of CPU cores the user wishes to allocate to the program
